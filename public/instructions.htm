  <h2>Decision-Making Experiment</h2>
  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    This session is part of a study in decision making.
    You will be paid at the end of the session. The amount of
    money you earn will depend upon the decisions you make and on the
    decisions other people make.

    <!-- <h3>Welcome to Stop/Go!</h3> -->
    <p>
      The experiment consists of three separate rounds called
      <strong>MATCHES</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will be assigned to be either the
      <strong>Red</strong> or the <strong>Blue</strong> player, and
      you will keep your role for all 3 matches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each match, you will be randomly and anonymously paired with a
      different player of the other role. You will never play again
      with the same player. Red moves first in the match, and has two
      choices: <strong>STOP</strong> or <strong>GO</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Red player chooses <strong>STOP</strong>, the match
      stops and each player receives a payoff
      of <span id="payoff-stop"> __ </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Red player chooses <strong>GO</strong>, it is the Blue player's
      turn to choose either <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong>. In
      this case, the payoff depends on what move the Blue player has made and on
      the <strong>state of the world</strong>, which is randomly chosen to
      be <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> according to the following
      probabilities:

      <ul>
        <li>state of world A: <strong><span id="probability-A">
        __ </span></strong></li>
        <li>state of world B: <strong><span id="probability-B">
        __ </span></strong></li>
      </ul>

      That is, <span id="probability-explained"> __ </span>. Each state of the
      world has a different payoff table, as shown below:
      
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div id="payoff-matrix-a" class="panel panel-default half-size">
        <div class="panel-heading">Payoff Table A</div>
        <!-- Payoff Table A added here on init-->
      </div>
      <div id="payoff-matrix-b" class="panel panel-default half-size">
        <div class="panel-heading">Payoff Table B</div>
        <!-- Payoff Table B added here on init -->
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      <em>Important!</em> Only the Red player knows the state of the
      world <em>before</em> making the decision. The Blue player
      will be informed only <em>after</em> making a decision. The
      state of the world is randomly reselected each match.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the last match, you will
      be paid the total amount you have earned during the course of all
      3 matches. Everyone will be paid in private and you do not have to
      tell anyone how much you earned.
    </p>

    game.
